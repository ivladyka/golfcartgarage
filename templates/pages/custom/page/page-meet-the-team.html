                    <h4>Owner</h4>
                    Dan, owner of Golf Cart Garage, grew up with a golf cart in his parents garage, and always loved taking long rides around the neighborhood with his family, usually right around when the sun was setting. When parts would inevitably break, like when his brother went joyriding and cracked the windshield, Dan knew there had to be an easier way to get parts quickly and at a reasonable price. So in 2014 Golf Cart Garage was born with a mission to make golf cart ownership easy and fun for everyone.

Through the years, she's learned about every different facet of the golf cart industry and as the Operations Manager now, is the reason that GCG functions so efficiently and skillfully. With 10+ years of customer service experience, she is our resident "team cheerleader" and nurtures a fun and welcoming environment for both customers and teammates alike. If she's not talking with customers (which she feels is the best part of the job!) or helping a team member solve a problem, you can probably find her down at the farm playing with her 4 dogs and 2 horses.

                    Dave is our resident gearhead, video host, and endless repository of horrible Dad jokes. He's always here to lend a hand with informative videos on customizations, repairs, how-to's, and quick tips... not to mention the occasional parody song. In his spare time, Dave loves to travel to new places for sight-seeing and concerts. Also, he's an accomplished musician, an avid reader, and hopes to someday be on an episode of "Somebody Feed Phil" just for the free travel and food. When asked what advice he'd give to new cart owners reading his bio, Dave replied, "The decision to replace certain parts is reversible, but the decision to drive through your neighbor's garden is not".

            <li>
                <p>More than 300,000 children worldwide are diagnosed with cancer each year. The mission of CancerFree KIDS is to eradicate cancer as a life-threatening disease in children by funding promising research that might otherwise go unfunded.</p>
                <p>CancerFree KIDS was founded by Ellen and Sam Flannery after their baby daughter was diagnosed with cancer in both of her eyes at 5 months of age. Today, thanks to cancer research, that baby is a healthy college student.</p>
                <p>Since its&rsquo; inception, CancerFree KIDS has funded 142 research projects totaling nearly $5.3 million. Funding goes directly to a research project where every dollar is accounted for.</p>
